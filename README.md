# projectTimeComplexity
This repository is for use in COMP 250, assignment on time complexity of algorithms.

The project contains a needed file HW2Prob2.

This project makes experimentation easier: Look for the “INSERT YOUR CODE HERE” comment; 
that is where to add each of the six code fragments provided in your assignment, one at a time.

The code is set up to read the value of n from the argument of the main method:
To provide the command-line argument n, 

* use the Run menu in IDEA;
* select Edit Configurations; and
* put the value of n in the box Program Arguments;
* click OK. Then
* run the program.

(Technically we read the value as an int m and then cast it to a long n to allow for very large integers.
This avoids integer overflow errors in some of the trials.)

For some of the code fragments and some values of n, the run time on modern processors is quite long.
For those inputs where the execution takes over 5 minutes, please stop running the program, 
and write “too long” in the table.
